## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add your OpenAI API key to your `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
The required packages are already installed:
- `openai` - OpenAI API client
- `langchain` - AI framework
- `recharts` - Chart library (already in your project)

### 3. Generate Sample Data (Optional)
If you want to test the AI with sample data:
```bash
npm run generate:sample-data
```

This will create:
- 20 sample vehicles
- 15 sample customers
- 25 sample test drives
- 8 sample transactions
- 6 months of sample metrics
- 5 sample vehicle submissions

## Usage Examples

### Sales Analysis
- "Show me this month's sales performance compared to last month"
- "What's our average profit margin on vehicles sold?"

## Data Types Supported

The AI can analyze these data types:

1. **Sales Data** (`sales`)
   - Transactions with profit margins
   - Monthly revenue trends
   - Sales performance metrics

2. **Inventory Data** (`inventory`)
   - Vehicle status distribution
   - Aging inventory analysis
   - Price and cost analysis

3. **Customer Data** (`customers`)
   - Customer sources and demographics
   - Customer behavior patterns
   - Lead conversion analysis

4. **Test Drive Data** (`testDrives`)
   - Appointment status tracking
   - Conversion rates
   - Scheduling patterns

5. **Sell/Trade Data** (`submissions`)
   - Request volume and types
   - Approval rates
   - Customer interest trends

## Customization

### Adding New Quick Actions
Edit the `quickActions` array in `src/app/admin/ai-assistant/page.js`:

```javascript
const quickActions = [
  {
    icon: <YourIcon className="w-5 h-5" />,
    title: "Your Custom Action",
    prompt: "Your custom AI prompt here"
  }
]
```

### Modifying AI Prompts
Update the system prompts in the API endpoints:
- `src/app/api/admin/ai-chat/route.js` - Main chat functionality
- `src/app/api/admin/ai-insights/route.js` - Insights generation

### Adding New Chart Types
Extend the `AIInsights` component in `src/components/admin/AIInsights.js` to add new visualization types.

## Security Considerations

- All AI endpoints are protected by admin authentication
- No sensitive customer data is sent to OpenAI (only aggregated metrics)
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- All requests are logged for audit purposes

## Cost Optimization

- Uses GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency
- Limits token usage with `max_tokens` parameter
- Caches responses where possible
- Filters data before sending to reduce context size

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to get response" error**
   - Check your OpenAI API key
   - Verify your API key has sufficient credits
   - Check network connectivity

2. **No data showing in charts**
   - Ensure you have data in your database
   - Run the sample data generation script
   - Check database connections

3. **Slow response times**
   - The AI analysis can take 2-5 seconds
   - Consider reducing data scope for faster responses
   - Check OpenAI API status

### Debug Mode
Add `console.log` statements in the API endpoints to debug data flow and AI responses.
